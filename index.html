      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>Lee Ann Norman graduated from UC Berkeley in 2010 with a degree in Molecular and Cell Biology and prepared to enter medical school the following Fall. However, after 3 years as a medical student at University of Cincinnati, Lee Ann decided to pursue software development which is where she found her true professional niche.</p>
      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>Lee Ann was born and raised in Southern California but spent much of her time growing up in the scorching heat that is Palm Desert. It was in La Quinta at her grandparents' home where Lee Ann began editing websites for fun (and mischief.)</p>
      <h1>Activities</h1>
      <p>Her favorite subjects have always been math and the sciences. However, she spends most of her spare time reading, writing short stories, working on her blog, and painting--proving that scientists can be artistic too!</p>
      <p>After discovering that neither the field of medicine nor the field of research would lead to a fulfilling career, Lee Ann's hopes were dwindling until she discovered the infinite world of coding.</p>
      <h1>Current Projects</h1>
      <p>Lee Ann hopes to use coding and her skills as a web developer to create effective websites for companies and their target audiences.</p>
      <h1>Current Residence</h1>
      <p>After moving from the fog that is San Francisco, Lee Ann settled in Texas. Currently, Lee Ann lives in Austin and is strengthening her coding skills so she is well prepared for the next promising opportunity as a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Whether it be developing websites for major companies or creating websites for an individual blogger, Lee Ann plans to use her programming skills to reach all audiences around the globe.</h1>
      <h1>Contact</h1>
      <p>Lee Ann's main interest is in freelance web development through which she will be able to stand behind a company or individual through web development. She is also interested in developing her own website which will focus on advancements in healthcare, medical ethics, and opinion articles</p>
      <p>Contact Lee Ann for web design, including those for private businesses, non-profit organizations, or personal blogs</p>
