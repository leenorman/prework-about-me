      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2010 with a degree in Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in immunology. After taking a year off post-graduation, I was accepted to University of Cincinnati College of Medicine where I completed three years of medical training to become a physician. After much contemplation, I decided the medical field was not for me and I withdrew after completing my clinical rotations.
      <p>After working as a research associate and lab manager at UC San Francisco, I realized laboratory research was not a perfect career fit either. I had no background in computer software or engineering but my father suggested I look into coding. I spent hours of my free time practicing coding and learning about web development before deciding to change career paths from biology to web development.</p>
      
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Southern California--Redlands and La Quinta. I have also lived in Huntington Beach, San Francisco, Berkeley, Scottsdale, Arizona, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Seattle. Now I'm an Austin resident!</p>
      
      <h1>Favorite Hobbies</h1>
      <p>Apart from coding, I spend my spare time reading, writing short stories, swimming, and painting. I am also a big Bob Dylan and Rolling Stones fan!</p>

      <h1>Dream Job</h1>
      <p>I hope to use the skills I gain from the UT bootcamp program to work as both a front-end and back-end web developer. I hope to mainly do freelance work for small companies or individual clients.</p>
      
      <h1>Current Residence</h1>
      <p>After living in Huntington Beach for a year, I moved to San Francisco and worked as a research associate. Upon discovering the opportunities for web developers in Austin, I packed two suitcases and made the move to Austin despite never having visited Texas in the past. I am loving Austin!</p>
      
      <h1>Why Web Wevelopment?</h1>
     <p>While laboratory work could, at times, be stimulating, the research I was involved with was very monotonous and routine. I have always loved math, art, puzzles, and learning new languages and love that coding encompasses all of these areas. Within the field of web development there is endless potential for growth and many opportunities for collaboration and ongoing learning. I have been coding unofficially since age 12--back when I had a MySpace page--but didn't realize it was coding! I am excited to translate my skills into this new career path!</p>
