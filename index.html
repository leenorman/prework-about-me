      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2010 with a degree in Molecular and Cell Biology with an emphasis in immunology. After taking a year off post-graduation, I was accepted to University of Cincinnati College of Medicine where I completed three years of medical training to become a physician. After much contemplation, I decided the medical field was not for me and I withdrew after completing my clinical rotations.
      <p>After working as a research associate and lab manager at UC San Francisco, I realized laboratory research was not a perfect career fit either. I had no background in computer software or engineering but my father suggested I look into coding. I spent hours of my free time practicing coding and learning about web development before deciding to change career paths from biology to web development.</p>
      
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Southern California--Redlands and La Quinta. I have also lived in Huntington Beach, San Francisco, Berkeley, Scottsdale, Arizona, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Seattle. Now I'm an Austin resident!</p>
      
      <h1>Favorite Hobbies</h1>
      <p>Apart from coding, I spend my spare time reading, writing short stories, swimming, and painting. I am also a big Bob Dylan and Rolling Stones fan!</p>

      <h1>Dream Job</h1>
      <p>I hope to use the skills I gain from the UT bootcamp program to work as both a front-end and back-end web developer. I hope to mainly do freelance work for small companies or individual clients.</p>
      
      <h1>Current Residence</h1>
      <p>After living in Huntington Beach for a year, I moved to San Francisco and worked as a research associate. Upon discovering the opportunities for web developers in Austin, I packed two suitcases and made the move to Austin despite never having visited Texas in the past. I am loving Austin!</p>
      
      <h1>Why Web Wevelopment?</h1>
      <p>While laboratory work could, at times, be stimulating, the research I was involved with was very monotonous and routine. I have always loved math, art, puzzles, and learning new languages. My father suggested I look into coding. So, with relucatance, I watched a YouTube video tutorial for Python. This led to another YouTube video which led to another one. After several days, I had watched hours and hours worth of coding and programming tutorials. I also found myself practicing coding on my free time--I was amazed that something so fun could lead to a rewarding professional future! 
      <p>I love that coding has aspects of all my favorite subject areas: math, problem-solving, language, art, and computer science. I also love that there is endless potential for growth. So, I decided to change career paths to web development!</p>
